description: >
  Setting up Vitest unit testing for your SharePoint Framework (SPFx) projects can be a manual and time-consuming process — from configuring dependencies and Jest-like setup to aligning TypeScript and project structures.

  In this session, I’ll first walk audience through how to manually configure an SPFx solution for Vitest — step by step — to understand what’s really happening under the hood.

  Then, we’ll take it a step further by leveraging GitHub Copilot and VS Code prompt files to automate the setup. Audience will see how a single, well-crafted prompt can transform your SPFx project into a Vitest-ready unit testing project in seconds!

  This session blends reverse engineering, AI-assisted development, and hands-on SPFx knowledge — empowering you to combine the best of developer expertise and AI acceleration to improve your testing workflow.
