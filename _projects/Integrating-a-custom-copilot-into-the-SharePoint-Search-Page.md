caption: Integrate a custom Copilot into the SharePoint Search Page
description: >
   Many of us utilize SharePoint Search, yet based on my observations, several non-developer end-users struggle to effectively navigate SharePoint Search to locate their desired content. This observation prompted me to consider enhancing SharePoint Search with a Copilot feature through an SPFx extension. This extension would incorporate a custom Copilot, drawing on SharePoint Site Content as its knowledge base. Have you considered the possibility of adding a custom copilot to your SharePoint site's search page? In this article, we will explore the how to integrate a custom copilot into the SharePoint Site Search Page via the SharePoint Framework (SPFx), with the goal of improving your SharePoint Search experience.
