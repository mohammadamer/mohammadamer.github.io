   Many of us utilize SharePoint Search, yet based on my observations, several non-developer end-users struggle to effectively navigate SharePoint Search to locate their desired content. This observation prompted me to consider enhancing SharePoint Search with a Copilot feature through an SPFx extension. This extension would incorporate a custom Copilot, drawing on SharePoint Site Content as its knowledge base.
