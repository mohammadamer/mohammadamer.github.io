description: >
   Microsoft Teams message extensions are a powerful tool that can enhance the messaging functionality of Teams. With message extensions, users can easily search for and share information through rich cards, capture data, and preview app content right within Teams. One way to take advantage of this functionality is by building a custom Teams message extension app that leverages the Graph Search API.
