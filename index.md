Thank you for taking the time to explore my blog! ðŸŽ‰

I began my journey in the tech industry as a .NET and SharePoint developer in 2009. Over the past decade, I've immersed myself in SharePoint and Azure backend development.

 Currently, I'm exploring client-side development, including SPFx not only but also Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Teams, and Microsoft Graph development.

The learning never stops! During my leisure time, I contribute to the SharePoint Framework (SPFx) Samples projects. For those unfamiliar, these open-source projects are invaluable for fully leveraging your M365 environment, allowing for comprehensive management and configuration with ease.

Thank you for buying the PRO version of Hydejack! ðŸŽ‰

More than one year ago I was looking for a blogging platform but couldn't find it:
One that would let me write posts in markdown with my own editor,
one that didn't look awful buy modern design standards, and one that felt snappy on a mobile phone.
That and more is now Hydejack. I hope you enjoy it [as much as I do](https://qwtel.com/).

## First Steps
Start by reading the [Documentation]{:.heading.flip-title}.
Specifically, the chapters below should be relevant now:

* [Install]{:.heading.flip-title} --- How to install and run Hydejack.
* [Config]{:.heading.flip-title} --- Once Jekyll is running you can start with basic configuration.
