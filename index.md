### Hi, I'm Mohammad
#### **Microsoft .NET & 365 Developer & Architect | Microsoft MVP | Open Source Contributor**

I am experienced .NET & Azure Solution Architect with over ten years of experience designing and delivering enterprise solutions using .NET, Microsoft 365, and Azure. My background spans SharePoint implementations, Microsoft Teams and SharePoint Framework (SPFx) development, and modern cloud-first architectures that align with enterprise strategies and security requirements.

I am passionate about leveraging Microsoft’s ecosystem including Azure services and Microsoft 365—to create scalable, secure, and business-aligned solutions that empower organizations and enhance collaboration. My expertise includes integrating CRM, productivity, and communication platforms, as well as designing architecture artifacts that support enterprise roadmaps.

In addition to solution design, I have led a team of developers, facilitated cross-functional collaboration, and communicated architecture decisions to both technical and business stakeholders. I am deeply engaged in the Microsoft 365 community, actively contributing to open-source initiatives and sharing knowledge through blogging and showing cases on Microsoft 365, SharePoint and Teams development.

🏅I’m proud to be recognized as a [Microsoft MVP](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-US/mvp/profile/70c07471-e35b-4100-97de-5df691ed2b24) in M365 Development, reflecting my commitment to driving
innovation and actively contributing to the community.

I am also deeply engaged in the Microsoft 365 community, contributing to open-source projects such as the SPFx Samples. These contributions provide valuable resources to help organizations and developers unlock the full potential of Microsoft 365.

💬 Let’s connect! I’m passionate about transforming complex technology into practical solutions anyone can apply. Whether you’re looking to collaborate, exchange ideas, or ask a question, I’d love to hear from you.
