🎉 Welcome to My Blog! 🎉

I’m thrilled to have you here! My journey in the tech world began back in 2009 as a .NET and SharePoint developer. Over the years, I’ve delved deep into SharePoint and Azure backend development, building a strong foundation in creating solutions that empower businesses.

Today, my focus has expanded to embrace modern client-side development with tools like SPFx, as well as cutting-edge technologies like Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Teams, and Microsoft Graph. It’s been an incredible journey of constant learning and growth, and I’m passionate about sharing what I’ve discovered along the way.

💡 Exciting News! I’m honored to be recognized as a Microsoft MVP in the M365 Development category. This prestigious award fuels my commitment to empowering the community through knowledge sharing and innovation.

In my free time, I actively contribute to open-source projects like the SharePoint Framework (SPFx) Samples, which provide invaluable resources for anyone looking to harness the full potential of their Microsoft 365 environment. These tools make it easier to manage, configure, and build on M365 with confidence.

💬 Let’s Connect!
I’m passionate about turning complex technology into practical solutions that anyone can use. If you have a question, want to collaborate, or just want to say hello, feel free to reach out or leave a comment. Together, we can continue this amazing journey of learning and building. 🚀

Thank you for buying the PRO version of Hydejack! 🎉

More than one year ago I was looking for a blogging platform but couldn't find it:
One that would let me write posts in markdown with my own editor,
one that didn't look awful buy modern design standards, and one that felt snappy on a mobile phone.
That and more is now Hydejack. I hope you enjoy it [as much as I do](https://qwtel.com/).

## First Steps
Start by reading the [Documentation]{:.heading.flip-title}.
Specifically, the chapters below should be relevant now:

* [Install]{:.heading.flip-title} --- How to install and run Hydejack.
* [Config]{:.heading.flip-title} --- Once Jekyll is running you can start with basic configuration.
